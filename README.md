This project explores deep neural networks using datasets like Red Wine and Spotify. I studied over/underfitting, detecting them via training vs. validation metrics, and applied fixes like dropout and batch normalization. Cross-entropy loss improved classification, while dropout boosted generalization, raising validation accuracy up to 77%.
